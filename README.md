## Description:
You are an abandoned ninja left to maintain balance within the sanctuary. 

An onslaught of ninjas approach your home and you must do whatever it takes to defend it!

Ensure order is maintained within the sanctuary by balancing your time within its regions. If you stay on one side for too long, the scales will break and you will not be able to recover what is lost!

Explore the rooms of the sanctuary and uncover loot locked within the map to help you against the never-ending onslaught. 

Slay as many ninjas as possible, and overcome the OVERTIME!

## Controls:
Movement: WASD
Shoot: Left click

## How to Play:
Overtime is a top-down survival game with the objective of killing as much ninjas as you can.

<i>Balancing the scales</i> :<br>
There are two timers on the top left and right side of the screen that represent the left and right sides of the map accordingly. A timer will decrease if you are on that side of the map, while the other side will gain time. If a timer reaches 0, you will lose that side of the map. Matching the timers will increase both times for a short duration.

<i>Survival</i>:<br>
While maintaining the scales balance, you must fight against the onslaught of ninjas.
As you survive,  new locations within the map will open up overtime and reward you with better resources to aid your survival. 
But keep in mind that as you become stronger, so does the enemy.

## Game Details

## Development Credits
<i>Models, Textures, UI designs, Animations</i><br>
For any clarifications, I designed all the assets used within the game, except for the Fog texture which I obtained from the [Eternal Temple Asset Bundle](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/fantasy/eternal-temple-65780) (which I have legally purchased).

<i>Audio</i><br>
I created the majority of "retro" sound files through BeepBox, including the background song.
For the remainder of audio clips, they are free sound effects from websites like MixKit and Fesliyanstudios.

<i>Fonts</i><br>
I obtained the Tron Font style from [fontget/tron](https://www.fontget.com/font/tr2n/).
